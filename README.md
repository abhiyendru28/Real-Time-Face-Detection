# Real-Time-Face-Detection
This project involves creating a system capable of detecting and tracking faces in real-time using a live camera feed. It utilizes the OpenCV library for its powerful and efficient face detection algorithms and the Pillow library for additional image processing functionalities.

# STEPS
- Run the face_taker.py to register your face.
- Run the face_train.py to train the model to recognize your face.
- face_recognizer.py will open your default camera which scans and recognize the face.
